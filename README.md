Assignment: Odin Project "Landing Page"

This project will require us to make a web page based on
the designs provided by The Odin Project. The page we
make does not need to be pixel perfect, but close enough.

This will be the second time I'll be creating a 
website from scratch. While I could leave the landing
page as a sterile page, I'll add images and other content
for a fictional weapon shop. 

This assignment will help reinforce what I've learned
from basic HTML, as well as utilizing CSS and Git/GitHub
for project management.


Requirements:
    **  Creation of basic HTML boilerplate & Link CSS Doc.

    **  Getting the basic layout of the page setup before
            CSS is applied.

    **  Using Flexbox/CSS to style the HTML doc.

    **  Applying comments throughout HTML/CSS.
            Note: This is VERY important, so be sure ya
            do it this time, Matt!

    **  Utilize git add, git commit, and git pushing
            continually as I work on and complete main
            portions of the page.

    **  Adhering to the reference image in terms of design
            and layout for the landing page.

Workflow Plan:
    **  Setup HTML Boilerplate
    **  Link CSS file to it.
    **  Link Images to page.
    **  Get general information/layout setup via HTML.
    **  Stylize with color/text options.
    **  Setup FlexBox for each individual Area

    are from the following games:
